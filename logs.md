**Hazel:** Researched possible electromagnetic setups and motor powering with a pico  

**Gabe:** Worked on CAD Model and buil prototype for 90 degree gearbox.  

**Challenges:**  
*Hysteresis-* Also known as electromagnetic saturation, hysteresis is the phenomenon in which after a certain voltage is applied cutting of power comes with inherent delay in loss of magnetism. This delay could be a major issue if a timed release is necessary.  
*Solution-* Unknown for long term, but we hypothesize that this delay will be insignificant for an electromagnet of our size. The issue seems to be scaled for voltage, of which we are not using much (relative to common applications of electromagnets).  
*Conclusion-* Problem only applies to systems between 0.2 and 0.5 Teslas. A Tesla is defined as one weber per square metre. The calculations of this unit for our electromagnet are beyond the scope of this project. That being said, a Tesla is a unit that we would never hope to intentionally reach at an educational facility, so all should be well.

**Productivity:** 10/10
