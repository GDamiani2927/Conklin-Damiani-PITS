### Design Goal
This design is inspired by the American startup, SpinLaunch. The company utilizes kinetic energy as opposed to traditional chemical jet prupolsion to launch their rockets, saving on launch time and fuel cost. One of the biggest bottlenecks in jet prupolsion is the infamous "rocket equation," an equation that will be discussed in depth later in this section. In simplest terms, this equation details that the more fuel you have on board, the returns of distance and prupolsion are diminished due to the higher mass of fuel. Kinetic launches bypass this, imagine a trebuchet instead launching a glider instead of a model airplane that has to have a battery, circuitboard, and other (fuel equivalent) componets. With the trebuchet, all of the potential energy is stored at the launch site in the counterweight, meaning that no potential energy needs to be stored within the payload itself. However, rudamentary kinetic systems like trebuchets and spring launches can only (literally) take you so far. However, a lot can be learned from how these systems function. If you track the trajectory of a payload within a trebuchet launch system, it follows an orbital path around the center of rotation.
