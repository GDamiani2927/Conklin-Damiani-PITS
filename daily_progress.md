**NOTE**: These daily progress logs started on 2/14/24. Prior to this date, all progress has been mostly theoretical. Sketches and planning performed in this interim period (since late November) will be added here eventually.

# Daily Progress
## 2/14/2024: 
* **Changed gear ratio from 20:1 to 9:1 to temporarily counterract motor pickup issues**. Interfacing a REV Robotics product with a piCO isn't as easy as expected, something's off with the power scale (power of 1 is nowhere near the max RPM boasted on the REV website). Ticks are now able to be read, with 28 ticks per revolution at the output shaft of the motor, but with a 9:1 gear ratio we can read 252 (28*9) ticks for every revolution. This is ideal because it allows us to know more precisely where the payload is at a given time, allowing us to time a release precisely without having to physically a photointerrupter. 252 may sound high, but this still isn't an optimal resolution, as we have an error of >1 degree. In the future we want to switch to a 20:1 gear ratio on the gearbox to increase this resolution for better consistency of release.

* **Improved the strength of the electromagnet** used for the release of the payload by utilizing double, triple, and quadruple wraps of copper wire. As it stands, the electromagnet pulls with nearly 3.5 N of force. To test if this is sufficient, further analysis of forces needs to be performed.
