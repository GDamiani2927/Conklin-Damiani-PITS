### Rocket Analysis
The rocket code was very straightforward and was one of the simplest parts of this project because the code was identical to the Data Storage assignment we completed earlier in the year. The code's only job is to track the acceleration of the rocket so we were able to completely reuse the code from the Data Storage assignment.
