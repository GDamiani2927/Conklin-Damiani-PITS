### Launcher Analysis


### Rocket Analysis
The rocket code was very straightforward and was one of the simplest parts of this project because the code was identical to the Data Storage assignment we completed earlier in the year. The code's only job is to track the acceleration of the rocket so we were able to completely reuse the code from the Data Storage assignment. The code uses the data.csv file to store the data the accelerometer receives while the Pico is in data mode so that it can be graphed once it is put back into code mode.
